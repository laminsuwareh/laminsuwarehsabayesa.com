        <p>
            Dear Past Me,
        </p>

        <p>
            Do you remember the days when life was a symphony of sounds—a world filled with 
            the melodies of laughter, the rhythm of conversations, and the hum of everyday life? 
            Back then, it seemed like those sounds would always be there, as natural as the air 
            you breathed. Little did you know that a single illness would redefine your reality 
            and take away the very essence of what once felt like an unshakeable certainty.
        </p>

        <p>
            After grade 6, when that illness struck, it wasn’t just your ears that suffered; 
            it was your spirit, your sense of identity, and the way you interacted with the 
            world around you. What do you do when you’re a child, expecting to grow up like 
            everyone else, only to have silence become your new normal? How do you find your 
            footing in a world that suddenly feels distant and unfamiliar? These were the 
            questions that haunted you, filling every moment with doubt and uncertainty. <br><br>

            Your parents, like you, grappled with the new reality, desperately seeking answers 
            and holding on to every glimmer of hope. Each hospital visit, each consultation, each 
            traditional treatment—it all blurred together in a whirlwind of desperate attempts to 
            reclaim the life that was slipping away. But then, just as you started to lose hope, 
            the faintest sound returned to your right ear. It wasn’t perfect, and it wasn’t the 
            full restoration you longed for, but it was something—a crack in the silence that gave 
            you the courage to move forward. <br><br>

            You returned to school, clinging to that fragile victory and determined to prove to 
            yourself that you could still thrive. With a hearing aid and a renewed sense of purpose, 
            you re-entered a world that didn’t wait for you to catch up. Every class, every 
            conversation, every social interaction was a battle—one that required you to be 
            constantly vigilant, to strain and focus in ways your peers couldn’t even imagine. 
            Yet you stood firm. You persevered. But just as you began to find your footing, 
            life dealt another blow: complete deafness. The world that had slowly started to 
            reopen seemed to collapse once more.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            What was left when the last echoes of sound faded? Would you be able to survive in a 
            world that communicates through voices you could no longer hear? You didn’t retreat; 
            you adapted. You mastered lip-reading, used your reading and writing skills as lifelines, 
            and powered through the remaining years of junior school. Silence, once a source of fear, 
            became your companion. You completed grade 9 with distinction, not because the journey 
            was easy but because you refused to be defined by your limitations. Every letter you wrote, 
            every word you read, and every concept you grasped became a triumph over adversity.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you entered senior school, the challenges multiplied. The oral English exams, a 
            seemingly insurmountable barrier, barred you from a part of the curriculum that others 
            took for granted. But did that stop you? No. You found another way, focusing on what 
            you could control and channelling your energy into your love for technology. When you 
            decided to pursue computer science at GTTI, you faced an entirely new set of trials. 
            Could you, a person with no formal training in sign language and no auditory input, 
            navigate a technical field that demanded constant communication and collaboration? <br><br>

            The answer was a resounding “yes.” You refused to let the walls of silence confine you. 
            Despite not having the means to communicate in conventional ways, you found your 
            language—the language of persistence, creativity, and problem-solving. Your journey 
            through GTTI was not just about learning to code or mastering concepts; it was about 
            proving to yourself and others that your worth wasn’t diminished by your disability. 
            Your resilience turned what others saw as a disadvantage into an undeniable strength. <br><br>

            And now, as a Backend Engineer, you’ve built a career that speaks to your 
            capabilities, your innovation, and your relentless spirit. But this journey was never 
            just about achieving professional success, was it? It’s about redefining what success 
            means for someone who has faced the loss of something so fundamental. You’ve taken silence, 
            an experience most people would shy away from, and turned it into a story of growth, 
            courage, and unyielding resolve. <br><br>

            Dear Past Me, the battles you fought paved the way for the life I now live—a life where 
            deafness is not a limitation but a facet of who we are. Your tenacity is the reason I 
            can stand here today and say, “I am not defined by my lack of hearing. I am defined by 
            what I choose to do despite it.” You are the foundation upon which I’ve built everything. 
            Every struggle you endured, every tear you shed, every doubt you conquered—all of it 
            contributed to the strength and clarity with which I now approach the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            What would you think if I told you that you would one day become an advocate, not just 
            for yourself but for countless others facing similar barriers? That you would stand as 
            a symbol of resilience and hope, proving that disability is not a measure of one’s 
            potential but a mere aspect of a much richer, more complex narrative? You would have 
            laughed or perhaps scoffed in disbelief. And yet, here I am, embodying that vision 
            and carrying forward the torch you lit during those silent nights filled with unanswered 
            questions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Past Me, you taught me that adversity doesn’t break us—it reveals our truest selves. 
            And I want you to know that every ounce of effort you invested, every moment of 
            perseverance you displayed, has blossomed into a life of fulfilment and purpose. 
            You’ve turned isolation into empowerment, pain into passion, and silence into a 
            powerful story that resonates beyond words. <br><br>

            Past Me, your journey has never been about reclaiming what was lost; it has always 
            been about embracing what remains and transforming it into something extraordinary.
            You are proof that the strongest voices are not always the loudest—they are the ones 
            that refuse to be silenced. 
            You have illustrated that disability does not equate to inability. You have proven 
            that no challenge can stifle your spirit if you possess the will to forge ahead. <br><br>

            In conclusion, Past Me, let us celebrate the journey we’ve undertaken together—the 
            triumphs and trials that have shaped who we are today. You’ve shown me that our identity 
            is not merely defined by the challenges we face, but by the courage and creativity with 
            which we respond to them. Each step forward has been a testament to our resilience, 
            illuminating the path for others who may feel lost in their silence. As I stand here now, 
            fueled by the lessons you imparted and the dreams you dared to dream, I promise to honour 
            your legacy by continuing to rise above, inspire change, and advocate for a world where 
            every voice—regardless of its volume—can be heard and celebrated. Together, we have 
            transformed our silence into a powerful anthem of hope, determination, and boundless 
            possibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            With love, <br>
            Your VerySelf, <br>
            Present Me.
        </p>
