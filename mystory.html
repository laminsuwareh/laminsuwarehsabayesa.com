            <p>
                My name is Lamin, and my journey through life has been marked by resilience, determination, and a refusal to let 
                challenges define me. I was born in Brikama Nyambai, West Coast Region, The Gambia. Growing up in Jamisa and 
                currently residing in Jalambang.
                Like any journey, my life has been filled with its fair share of challenges and triumphs. One particular event that shaped my path occurred 
                during my primary school years when I faced a significant health setback. <br><br>
                After completing grade 6, I encountered an illness that resulted in hearing loss, presenting me with a unique set of obstacles to overcome.
                Recognizing the severity of my condition, my parents made the difficult decision to take a break from school. During this time, 
                I sought medical treatment from both traditional and modern sources, hoping for a remedy that would restore my hearing. Throughout this period, 
                I remained resilient and determined to regain my ability to hear and communicate effectively.
                Through perseverance and determination, I found hope when, fortunately, before the start of the following academic year, 
                I began to regain sound in my right ear. This positive development fueled my determination to continue my education and 
                overcome the challenges that lay ahead.

            <!-- <figure class = "caption">

                <figcaption>Photo of me wearing hearing aid.</figcaption>

            </figure> -->

            <p>
                With my newfound ability to hear in right ear, I was to be enrolled at Saint John's School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. 
                However, after conducting tests, it was determined that I didn't meet the qualifications to study there since I could still 
                hear some sounds and speak fluently. Instead, I was provided with a hearing aid to use during my regular schooling. <br><br> Returning 
                to my former school, I continued my education alongside my able-bodied peers. Despite the difficulties of adjusting to my hearing impairment, 
                I remained resolute in my pursuit of knowledge. Determined to succeed, I faced each obstacle with a determined spirit, refusing to let my 
                condition define me or limit my potential. <br><br> Unfortunately, my journey took another turn when I lost hearing in my right ear, leaving 
                me completely deaf. Despite this setback, I remained determined to overcome any obstacles that came my way. I stopped using the hearing aid 
                and relied on my talent for lip-reading, as well as my ability to read, write, and understand English.
                With unwavering determination, I completed the rest of my junior school education in this new situation. Despite the challenges posed 
                by my hearing loss, I persevered and successfully passed my grade 9 examination with flying colors. This achievement fueled my desire 
                to continue my education and pursue my passions.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enrolled in Gambia Senior Secondary School, where I focused on studying pure science and sat the school leaving certificate examination. 
                Although my condition prevented me from taking the oral English exam, I remained undeterred. I recognized that my abilities surpassed 
                the limitations imposed by my disability, and I channelled my determination into excelling in my academic pursuits.
            </p>

            <p>
                Driven by my passion for technology, I sought to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. I enrolled at Gambia Technical Training 
                Institute (GTTI) to study computer science and information technology. Despite not knowing sign language, I fearlessly immersed myself in 
                a learning environment alongside my able-bodied peers. With an unwavering belief that my abilities would transcend any limitations, 
                I tackled the challenges head-on and honed my skills in the realm of technology. I firmly believed that my abilities and potential were 
                not defined by my disability but rather by my dedication and perseverance.<br><br>
                Today, I proudly serve as a Backend Engineer at <a href="https://assutech.gm/" target="_blank">Assutech,</a> where I continue to nurture my passion for technology and innovation. 
                I firmly believe that disability does not equate to inability. I am determined to make a positive impact in the world and show that 
                with determination and resilience, we can overcome any obstacles that come our way.
                By showcasing my capabilities and embracing my 99 abilities despite my one disability, I aim to inspire others to challenge societal 
                norms and embrace their unique potential.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In my journey through life, I have learned that disability does not limit one's potential for success. I refuse to let my hearing loss
                define me, instead focusing on my 99 abilities. I aim to inspire others by showing them that with perseverance, hard work, and an unwavering
                belief in oneself, any challenge can be overcome. My journey as a Backend Engineer is not just about proving myself to others but also about 
                making a difference and breaking down barriers for individuals with disabilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                My journey from encountering an illness resulting in hearing loss to where I stand today has been one of resilience, determination, 
                and personal growth. I have learned that setbacks are not roadblocks but opportunities for self-discovery and strength. My experiences have shaped 
                my belief that as long as there is a will, there is always a way. I am committed to sharing my story, not just through words but through my actions, 
                proving that disability is not a limitation but a catalyst for empowerment and success.<br><br>
                I am a firm believer that actions speak louder than words, and I strive to lead by example, showing others that they too can overcome any 
                obstacles in their path. I am grateful for the unwavering support of my family, the opportunities that education has provided me, and the 
                unwavering belief in my abilities that propels me forward.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I continue on this path, I am ready to embrace new challenges and make a positive impact in the world. I am driven by a desire to empower 
                others to embrace their unique journeys and defy societal norms. By demonstrating that disability does not limit one's potential, I hope to 
                inspire others to pursue their dreams and never give up.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, my name is Lamin Suwareh, and I am proof that with determination, resilience, and a belief in oneself, anything is possible. 
                I refuse to let my hearing loss define me, and I am committed to using my 99 abilities to create a brighter future, both for myself and for others.
