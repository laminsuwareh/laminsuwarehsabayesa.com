                My name is Lamin M.K Suwareh. I was born on 3<sup>rd</sup> May in Brikama Nyambai, 
                West Coast Region, The Gambia. I grow up 
                in Jamisa and currently living in Jalanbang. I did my Primary school at 
                Presentation of Mary Basic School and upon completing grade 6, I 
                encountered an illness which resulted giving me hearing loss. After 
                encountering the illness, I skipped school for a year seeking medication from 
                both traditionally and modernly and fortunately before resuming school the 
                following academy year, I was able to hear sound in my right ear.
            </p>

            <!-- <figure class = "caption">

                <figcaption>Photo of me wearing hearing aid.</figcaption>

            </figure> -->

            <p>
                I was then taken to Saint John’s school for the deaf and hard of hearing to 
                proceed my education there but after conducting test on me, they decided that 
                I wasn’t qualified to learn with them because I was hearing some sounds in my right 
                ear and also speaking fluently. Thus, I was given a hearing-aid to use in school. 
                I went back to my former school and continue my education with abled people. 
                But unfortunately before I complete grade 7, I lost hearing in my right ear 
                too, thus I became completely deaf. I stopped using the hearing-aid and 
                continued my education through my talent of lip reading and ability to read, 
                write and understand English. 
            </p>
                

            <p>
                I did the rest of my junior school in that situation 
                and with the determination, I sailed through the obstacles. I sat my grade 9 
                examination and passed it in flying colors. I moved to Gambia senior secondary 
                school where I studied pure science and sat the school leaving certificate examination but missed oral 
                English exam due to my condition.
            </p>

            <p>
                I later move to Gambia Technical Training Institute (GTTI) where I studied 
                computer science information technology. I learned with the abled 
                people there too since I didn’t learn sign language. I believe I can do whatever the
                abled people can do because Disability does not tantamount to Inability 
                and as long as there is will, there is always a way. 
                I am Currently a Frontend Developer @assutech.
            </p>
            

            <p>
                I want to do my fight not by telling people but by showing them that I can do it. 
                I have 1 disability, but 99 abilities.
