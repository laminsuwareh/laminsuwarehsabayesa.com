                One beautiful Afternoon, my mom came to my room and informed me that one of my 
                uncles who lives in Gunjur - south Gambia has called me to go and participate 
                in the national polio immunization days that was about to tee-off. 
                She told me that my uncle registered his son to participate for the vaccination 
                but unfortunately he was sitting an examination that is why he wanted me to go
                replace him. I made no objection to that since I was not going to school and 
                also been jobless. That very evening, I packed my bag and went 
                to my uncle home in Gunjur and spent the night there.
        </p>

        <figure class = "caption">

        </figure>

        <p>
                The following morning I bathed and went to Gunjur health center to attend the workshop. 
                Later the morning, the workshop began. The organizers and the nurses taught us how to carry out 
                the job to vaccinate children and take records. After they were done, they divided us into 
                groups of two each to perform the job the following two days. I was paired with a lady who was 
                about five years older than I was. We exchanged some pleasantries but after she realized that 
                I was deaf in ears, she left me there and went inside the hospital and informed a staff whom she knew 
                that she wouldn’t pair with me.
        </p>
                

        <p>
                The staff then came and tried to pair me with other participants especially the boys, 
                but they all refused. There was a lot of brouhaha. Some participants were making 
                fun of me and saying to each other that I went there because of money. After a 
                shot discussion among them, I was told to go home, thus disqualified. I handed 
                back the t-shirt given to me to wear during the vaccination period, but I was 
                told to take it.  
        </p>

                <figcaption>Photo of the t-shirt given to me.</figcaption>

        </figure>

        <p>
            Amid the suck, I stood up, ready to go home. There was 
            contempt focus on my attention. I thought my legs wouldn’t 
            perform there functions but they did no such thing. Had I been aware of 
            that disgrace, I would have simply not accepted my uncle's request let
            alone bother myself going there. Been a disabled person, I was the talk of the day, 
            almost every tom, dick and harry have something to say about me.
            I left the hospital campus and walked about two hundred meters back 
            home without looking back.   
        </p>
            
        <h2>
            Looking back!
        </h2>


        <p>
            Imagine yourself nine years ago just like me...<br><br><b> Where did you live?<br>  
            How was it there?<br> Where do you work?<br>
            what were your dreams?<br> What were your struggles?</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Step into that time and become that person for a moment. From that place, now 
            look forward.<br> What do you think of your life now?
        </p>

        <p>
            One of three things will be true:
        </p>

        <ul>
             <li>
                    Life is better now.   
             </li>
             <li>
                    Life is the same now.
             </li>
             <li>
                    Life is worse now.
             </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
             Which is true for you? Hold that thought. Hold that emotion.
        </p>

        <p>
            Step into that time and become that person for a moment. From that place, now 
            look forward.<br> What do you think of your life now?
        </p>

        <h3>
            On reaching home!
        </h3>

        <p>
            On reaching home, I already meet my uncle there. He told me he was called to 
            answer at the hospital and thus closed work before his closing time. He advised
            me to not over think about the incident that took place and also gave me some words 
            of encouragement. My aunty on the other hand reaction was different to my uncle’s.
            She put all the blames on the staffs and my colleagues. She complained that I 
            should be allowed to participate by force. That evening I left for home. I met my 
            mom who already knew everything even before my arrival. She responded to my plights 
            by giving me more words of encouragement. <br> This was one of the incidents that make me 
            thick and never try to give up even for a second. And I will never give up Inn Shaa Allah!
